Using the template: 

GrantProposalWriting_Schiefner.tex is the main file. You will need to compile this once to get your desired output. 

Known issues: 

- The template does not include any tools for including a bibliography in the current version. You will need to implement this yourself. 
- NWO requires the text to be in verdana. I have not managed to implement this so far. 
- Missing CV
